# UE4 Blank Project

* Remember to include your name in this `README.md` file.
* Update the controls and instructions on how to play your game. Even if you are copying my walk throughs verbatim, just include which controls you ended up using.
* Remember to always include a [.gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/UnrealEngine.gitignore) file in the same directory as the `PROJECTNAME.uproject` file.
